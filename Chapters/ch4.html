<div id="chapter" class="container">
<p class=MsoNormal><Light>She spasms again, and I struggle to keep my hands clasped around hers. 
Maintaining my prayer, I
look up onto the bed where she lays, and watch as beads of sweat flow through the 
pained wrinkles of her golden forehead. Again I find myself in awe: that flawless yellow skin, that
impossibly long, crimson hair. And such an ornate, intricate tunic! Truly, an angel! But,
why does she suffer? Has she fallen from God’s grace? Or perhaps this is a
test, to measure my dedication to Him before I can ascend? This bizarre room has no supplies I could
 use to treat her fever, so I must rely on the
strength of my belief. I reaffirm my grip on her hand, and pray harder. <i>Oh Lord, please-</i></Light></p>

<p>At the same time, <i><Sy>through bleary, tear-filled eyes, the boy can barely make
out the shifting shapes in the shadows. Something is taking slow, deliberate
steps towards the table, towards him, but the idiot doesn’t have the common
sense to try to do anything</Sy>.</i></p>

<p>At the same time <Igelet>I’m sitting curled in a bed, my back
against the corner. </Igelet>Although
this room is identical to the previous, everything looks distinctly less alien.
The green on the floor isn’t grass, it’s carpet. And
affixed to the walls aren’t balls of heavenly energy, but light bulbs. The
structure of the room with the two beds and the desks give the distinct
impression of a shared dormitory room. With no door, only white walls.</p>

<p>These observations are completely secondary, however, to this new sensation smouldering
in my chest. Complete fear. A dull pain on the back of my hand as I scratch at
it unrelentingly.<Igelet> Where am I? How did I get here? And-</Igelet></p>

<p><Igelet>The body in the other bed
tosses! -</Igelet>

<p><span style='font-size:300%';><dilation>!*@#</dilation></span></p>

<p><Light>She violently twitches in the
bed again, and I duck as her arm thrashes towards me. I bring a hand to her
forehead: even warmer than before! I must pray harder! Lord, please help her,
or provide me with the means to heal her!</Light></p>

<p>The pain in that instant was indescribable, and… real? More
real than the rest of everything else I can perceive. It has cut away at the
seams of the world… that which I see before me is no more than a cascade of images…
fleeting observations. A reality unto themselves, but not mine.</p>

<p><Igelet>Oh thank God, he's still asleep. My plans to have tried to talk would never
have worked anyway. I mean… it’s <i>blue</i>! Is
it even human? Does it even speak my language? It… no, it’s a <i>he</i>, I’m sure. Though, if it is an alien,
how can I be sure?</Igelet></p>

<p><i><Sy>A monstrous foot smoothly connects with the floor mere
inches from the boy’s leg, claw tips catching the tiles with a soft Click. The
boy’s screams lodge in his throat as his gaze travels up that impossibly bulky,
green-scaled limb. Now he succumbs to terror, his blood freezing over and
locking all his limbs in place. Strangely, the flash of terror gives brief
comfort to the child.</Sy></i></p>

<p><Light>Something has changed. Her
breathing is no longer haggard, but suffocatingly
short and shallow. The intense lustre in her face has diluted to a pale
yellow akin to straw. I check her forehead again – cold! How can this be? A second ago I was
sure that this was a fever, but… could it be a nightmare? Father had mentioned
this during a visit once – demons are capable of manifesting in your mind if
the words of the Lord had not reached you the preceding evening. And I remember
his advice – I must channel the words of the Lord loudly, to chase the demons
from their nest!</Light></p>

<p><Igelet>What's that sound? For an instant I felt so incredibly close to activating the Dilation,
 but I don't want this to be interrupted! What is being said? I bring my ear closer to the wall – it sounds
like a girl shouting... I can't make out the words. It doesn’t sound angry or scared, I think. It
reminds me of how people would raise their voice in an argument to be heard.
Could she be my captor? It sounds too young to be an adult, I think, so perhaps she's
 in the same boat as me? Perhaps I could knock on the wall to signal I’m here… but what if that woke up
the one in the other bed?</Igelet></p>

<p><Igelet>The other bed creaks again-</Igelet></p>

<p><span style='font-size:300%';><dilation>!*@#</dilation></span></p>

<p><Light>She spasms again, and she moans
dully – am I waking her? It must be working.<Light></p>

<p>What IS
that?! Such a pain rocking my perception of everything. But, in the aftermath
there’s an odd comfort. I’m myself – this is me, right? This thought, this
curiosity, it is richer and more tangible than everything else. Yet I feel
myself slipping again…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>“Lord! Before you we kneel, and
thank you for your light that protects us as we walk through <span class=GramE>Your</span>
garden. Please take this lost cub in your hands and shield her from the forces
that would befoul your name.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>I look down. I’m now standing
over her, my arms splayed out to receive God’s will, as I had seen Father do
many times. Am I being loud enough? I think Father sounded more impactful with
his words. Am I doing this right? No! I must not allow doubt dull the sharpness
of my belief! I draw myself to fell height, and close my eyes as I start again
even louder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#0070C0'>I snap my gaze back to the bed –
thank God again, he’s still asleep. I need to come up with a plan. At some point he’s
going to wake up. I think it’s safe to assume that he’s like me – confused and
lost in a new environment. For all I know, he has been here for longer than me.
I only just woke up… Wait, how long have I been awake? There’s no clock in the
room – I should have checked my phone when I woke up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#0070C0'>Of course! I quickly start
rooting through my pocket to reach my phone, whilst trying to be as quiet as
possible. I press the home button and… no reception. Or internet. Damn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#0070C0'>But, the time – this can’t be
right? It says <span class=GramE>it’s</span> past midnight. No. But my last
memory, me stepping up the path towards my house - it’s been 10 hours since
then! How was I kidnapped? Tranquilised and brought here? What will Mum and Dad
say? They’ll probably be really angry that I haven’t got home by now. But, what
if they have been taken as well? Oh no oh no <span class=SpellE>ohnoohnononoononono</span>-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:300%';><dilation>!*@#</dilation></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>She shakes once more, and this
time I hear a distinct grunt escape her lips. I must be close!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something’s happening. Everything’s getting fuzzier, less
distinct. I can’t focus… or is it that I’m focussing too much? This is
unbearable. Is this all there is? Will it ever end?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='color:#00B050'>The monster suddenly rears back and shrieks, louder and
more ferociously than anything the boy had ever heard in his life.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>“LORD, BEFORE YOU WE KNEEL -”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:300%';><dilation>!*@#</dilation></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, all of the world snap into one. But, not one. I
can see… no, not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>see</i>. There is a
darkness, but it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> darkness. My
eyes are closed. And what I hear, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i>
hear it, but I also hear it differently, as though I’m the one speaking in that
loud cadence. I open my eyes to see the world – <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>my world - </i>blossom into existence before me. The first <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sight</i>, the first and most real, most
tangible proof of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me.</i> A plain white
ceiling, with the only source of light eclipsed by the looming figure at my
bedside. Her dark green face frozen momentarily, her eyes wide, her mouth hung
open mid-syllable. And at the same time <span style='color:#FFC000'>I see the
girl on the bed, her eyes opened just wide enough for me to see her vibrant, light-blue eyes.
She's still clearly on the cusp of unconsciousness - she groggily struggles to move her head, a difficult endeavour due to 
her incredibly long hair wrapping around her body in a chaotic red halo. Joy and
pride bloom within me – I did it! My devotion has reached her!</span> I see the
green girl’s face break into a joyous smile, and I also see the yellow girl in the
bed smile too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I… I’m not the one feeling this, but I am? I feel happy,
excited, <span class=GramE>proud</span>. But, it’s not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>me</i> <span class=SpellE>me</span>. There’s a subtle hollowness to the
emotion, but I still feel warmth from it.</p>

<p><dilation>!*@#</dilation></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recoil, throwing my hands to my head. There it is again!
Less intense than before, but this time it came completely unexpectedly. Wait,
had I expected it before? I say <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i>…
but who is that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite my hand obscuring my vision, I can <span
style='color:#FFC000'>still perceive the yellow girl on the bed, who has thrown
her hands to her head as she jolts in agony. My joy evaporates, and I fall to
my knees and clasp her hand again. </span>Confusingly, as I pull it from her
face, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> world illuminates as I feel
another hand pulling at mine. I look up – the green girl has my hand clasped
between hers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wait… this position, the two views I can see… am I the golden
girl? The one in pain? The one sweating and only just woken up?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please, speak to me! You are an angel, correct? I am
honoured to be in your presence! How do you feel?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This voice sounds different, less confident through my own ears. 
Angel? Well… that sounds right. My skin, my hair, my holy
gown. <span style='color:#FFC000'>All the depictions of angels I saw growing up
would indicate-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wait, no I didn’t. I didn’t do that. That experience, I can
still sense the tinge of hollowness. Those countless memories of gazing up to
the stained glass and pouring over <span class=GramE>holy scripture</span>,
those aren’t mine. But here I am, recalling them. Like here I am, seeing all
these things, feeling all these things, at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>The girl’s eyes softly knit in
consternation, as </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='color:#00B050'>a perfectly blue sky, the sun stands high overhead, the
waves gently roll and crash mere metres before him over the pristine white
sand.</span></i><span style='color:#00B050'> </span><span style='color:black;
mso-themecolor:text1'>What a beautiful world – I skip a breath in awe. So much
space, so much more than this… but what’s this dread building within me? </span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='color:#00B050'>Get back home as
soon as possible!</span></i><span style='color:#00B050'> </span><span
style='color:#FFC000'>Slowly, with a weakness I have only seen only in the
oldest of parishioners, she reaches one arm into the air above her, stretching
out her fingers as through trying to grasp at some far-off, intangible object
visible only to her. Slowly, the hand collapses into a shaking fist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>“Get… me…
home…” </span><span style='color:#FFC000'>the yellow</span><span style='color:
black;mso-themecolor:text1'>- I mean, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i>
– rasp softly. Despite that sentence clearing all the air from my lungs, the
magnetic attraction to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>home</i> pulls at
me. I need to be there. Before it happens, before it can hurt them. This isn’t
the time to be weak and pathetic. I need to get moving!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>“Please,
stop!” the priest’s daughter commands as she gently yet firmly stops me from
trying to roll out of bed. “You are in no condition to be moving right now! I
will get you home, if it’s the last thing I do. But before that, I need you to
rest!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>Oh, of
course. I am a patient, an angel in distress. I need to place my faith in the
Lord’s eternal love, and He shall guide me towards recovery. This realisation
dissipates my panic over… what was it again?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>“Okay, good,
good, here, let me fix your pillow,” Light says tenderly as she reaches behind
my head. “Now tell me about yourself.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>Wait… I
haven’t planned for this! Why wouldn’t I have planned it? I’m here in the
presence of a complete stranger looking after me – how should I respond? I need
to be honest, but what if she thinks I’m being overly dramatic, or if I somehow
worry her unnecessarily? This isn’t good, I need time to think… but why isn’t
the Dilation triggering? Normally by now-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>Wait, it
happened again. Or, did it happen a few times? My rising panic falls like a
curtain cut from its supports, leaving the expanse of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>me</i> unobstructed again. What’s happening?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>“What’s
happening?” I ask, and again I feel a wave of dizziness as though I had
forgotten to breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>“I believe… I
am not sure, there is no reason to be alarmed. I woke up in the bed behind me
not a few minutes ago, when I saw your poor condition. I am sure we will be
tended to soon, and we can ask for medicinal supplies.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>That’s what I
heard, the sensation which stuck out most to me. But at the same time, a more
subtle wave of comprehension washed over her words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>I believe that I have passed
into the afterlife – wait, no, I cannot possibly say that! This test, whatever
it is, is not about me, it must be about my ability to help this angel. In that
case: I am not sure, there is no reason to be alarmed. I woke up in the bed
behind me not a few minutes ago, when I saw your poor condition. I am sure we
will be tended to soon, and we can ask for medicinal supplies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time, I try to focus on the distinction between the two
perceptions. The weaker hangs like a thin veil before my reality, and it
crumbles as I try to focus on my perspective. Okay, this is making sense. I
think I’m waking up. The sensation was unusual at first, but I think I’m
getting used to it. But my body… as I test my limbs, I find I can barely move.
I’m devoid of strength, but I don’t feel overt muscular fatigue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A gentle feeling of trepidation washes over me, but now I
instinctively take a mental step back, as I look at the veil of the feeling I
realise it to be from Light. She’s worried about my condition, but also about
her ability to adequately treat me, lest her soul suffers the consequences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is your name?” she asks, yet I realise that I ‘heard’
it before she had said it. The veil of her perception of reality had
broadcasted the question an instant previous, at the moment it formulated in
her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Light,” I reply breathlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wait, that isn’t right. I’m peering through the veil of
Light’s perception again. I tune it out of my perception, but I don’t have an
answer. I don’t have a name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes?” she asks, mistaking my answer for the beginning of
a question. I sense the twinge of doubt – she thinks she may be
bothering me with the questions. But at this is replaced by deep-seated
reverence, as she realises that she had never introduced her own name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I… I don’t know… my name,” I struggle to say. It’s like
having a weight placed upon me, or trying to speak after being winded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hang on, here it is again. Where am I drawing this
information upon? Why can I conceive the ideas of times I have tripped and
knocked the wind out of me, times I have spent so much time fighting in a
street that I can barely move the next day, when I have no memories upon which
to recollect? Once again I try to mentally step back, and the answer lays bare
before me: all of these memories, concepts, notions, I can see them wrapped
around me as a dense set of layered veils. Therefore, they are not mine. They
are so well-integrated, that I can’t even necessarily distinguish whose is
whose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#FFC000'>She can’t remember her name. And
the way she keeps cradling her head sporadically - poor creature, perhaps the
source of her illness was a blow to the head? Just like earlier when I... no, this is not about me!
I remember when Spark hit his
head a few years back – when he woke up, he didn’t remember the entirety of the
previous day. Her memories will be back in time, but I need to find something
to call her in the meantime, and it must be such that she knows the deep
respect I have for her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Light bends down, and with one hand she takes a careful hold
of own of mine, while the other hand gently cups my cheek. The contact is
solid, grounding, and reassuring – I feel myself relaxing a bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do not fear, I am sure you will remember after a little
rest. Until then, I’ll just call you Angel, okay? And please understand, I will
be your loyal servant for as long as you need.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The veils of other egos layer up, increasing in density. I
am losing myself. Am I passing out? It seems – my real sight is blurring at the
same rate as I more clearly see myself through Light’s eyes. <span
style='color:#FFC000'>As she seems to relax and close her eyes, I can’t help
but feel a little calmer. I got a bit flustered there – this is unbecoming of
my station. But I’m sure she heard my last words to her. Lord, thank you for
blessing me with this trial. I know that I will be able to redeem myself for
the lapse of conviction I showed when you tested me before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='color:#00B050'>The boy under the table pathetically chokes back on his
sobs. What a stupid child: how can he really believe that he’s concealing
himself?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#0070C0'>Hang on, there’s a draw on this
bed-side table. Slowly, silently I tug on the handle: thank goodness, it
doesn’t creak or anything! What’s this in here? Another phone? No, it’s closer
in size to a small tablet. I pick it up, making care not to hit the sides of
the draw, and press the power on its edge. The screen glows with a faint light
blue, as though loading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
